# springboard_eda

This repository contains my 3 mini projects from Springboard's Inferential Statistics - Exploratory Data Analysis section. The three projects are:

- Human Body Temperature Using EDA
- Examine Racial Discrimination Using EDA
- Reduce Hospital Readmissions Using EDA

Human Body Temperature Using EDA examines the differences in body temperature from the perceived normal of 98.6 degrees farenheit. 
Racial Discrimination Using EDA examines the effect of callback rates of black vs white sounding names on a resume.
Reduce Hospital Readmission Rates Using EDA examines the relationship between number of discharges and the ratio of readmission rates.

Each of these Python notebooks contain questions and responses using statistical analysis to support my conclusions.
